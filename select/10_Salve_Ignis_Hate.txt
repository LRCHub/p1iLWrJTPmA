At signal of the chime primordial
Spark rebellion and plunge in its flames
The day all temples of trash crumble
Ravage the lairs of vipers and tear down
The walls of their strongholds
Le the cauldron of suffering boil!

Make the hearts of darkness swell
Guide our fury through this struggle
Let death cry out in their throats
Enlightened guardian of blood
Slay my foes at sinister dawn
Breed slaves sworn to the atrocious war!

Cauterized with burning iron
No saviour exists here no more
Lost chance of divine

Centuries watch them rise
Through the blood-soaked eyes
Centuries watch them die
Through the eyes of Doom

The Sun is black, thy flesh cast down
Entombed among the walls of mighty Arkhen
The winter passes by and storm has come
As thunder of bright Perun strikes the earth

Centuries judge the earth
Through the blood-soaked eyes
Centuries watch them die
Through the eyes of Doom

The might of Veles's darkness in serpents's eye
Transcending space and time to mighty Arkhen
The winter passes by and storm has come
The kings have thrown their crowns
Into the void

Solo: Domin

The empire extends
Majestic Ignis
Reaches as far as the soul thrives
In fire and turmoil

Behold! blood-soaked eye!
Behold! blood-soaked eye of doom!
Sanctuary!
