Never exhume me
Don't want you anymore
Colors fading
You took all that I want
Memories brimming and I hope you know though
I am bleeding eternally for you

Lying stars
You make me dream of bliss
Greedy mind and
Nothing is so right
Fear is compressed and my stomach aches
You could amaze me more and forever

I can't believe this isn't a dream
My lucent orb is fading bright
I can't believe it was a dream
So hard to reignite myself

I can't believe this isn't a dream
Is this the way we end up?
I can't believe it was a dream
Flashback is all I got in my hand?

Violet Sky
You know what this means?
I had been always there for you
Now I'm ready to dive in danger zone
Know for sure because this is the way I am

Spatial patterns deep inside of me
Lose yourself on accumulated ground
All I know is my soul unbreakable
Light a blue fire and watch until the shape is gone

I can't believe this isn't a dream
My lucent orb is fading bright
I can't believe it was a dream
So hard to reignite myself

I can't believe this isn't a dream
Is this the way we end up?
I can't believe it was a dream
Flashback is all I got in my hand?

Crystallizing soul
Live in delusion
Crystallizing soul
Live in delusion

I can't believe this isn't a dream
My lucent orb is fading bright
I can't believe it was a dream
So hard to reignite myself

I can't believe this isn't a dream
Is this the way we end up?
I can't believe it was a dream
Flashback is all I got in my hand?
